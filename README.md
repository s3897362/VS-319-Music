To setup:
- install node.js, https://nodejs.org/en
- in terminal navigate to directory ../msl-web-demo
- in terminal run npm install
- in terminal run npm start

Current functionality:
currently this is setup as a demo for the code to interperet the JSON files containing excercise score,
it is able to plot graphs based of new functions with some limitations,
currently hardcoded and inflexible is the time signature and accuracy bars,
new ones would need to be made to suit other excercises and we recommend doing so if you wish to expand the prototype

Other functions
- Number of measures, changes the number of measures currently displayed
- Scroll, allows for scrolling, number of measures has to be less than max (16 in this case) for this to be visible
- Toggle stepped lines, changes line graphs to stepped line graphs
